# PIMP YOUR CURRICULUM!

# How does design, communication and interaction connect?

We want you to work with many of the tools that you have already been introduced to during the
1st semester relating to design, communication and interaction. Your task - and your learning - will
focus on the interrelationship between these different topics/disciplines. We want you to realize
how everything connects and how they are all interdependent.


Your task is to transform the MMD CURRICULUM into an appealing and interesting website!
It seems to be a simple and hopefully manageable assignment - but you will have to work a lot to
achieve a well-considered and durable solution.


# TASKS: 
• Make a communication plan (where you appoint target group, message etc.)

• Read the curriculum and agree on what part of the content you will need to present on
your site (this will be dependent on your communication plan; who is it for? what do you
want to achieve?)

• Consider how you want to “chunk” the information (what info belongs together and how
should it be divided into “information nodes” (“stuff” that can be presented on one (sub)
page)

• Consider how you want to order it hierarchically (which information is most important?
what should your users see first and how should they “work their way” through the
information?)

• Build a navigation system (using a new user test: Card sorting - as well as your own
considerations)

• Present it in a flow chart

• Build wireframes of all pages, indicating where content and navigation should be located.

• Decide on - and develop a “functional” design that uses all the rules about “good design”

you have learned during 1st semester, such as gestalt laws, contrasts, colours, typefaces
etc. in order to add clarity to the navigation and usability of your site.

• Make an Expert Review (with the teachers as experts) to evaluate your first iteration.

• Make a Bipolar Emotional Response Test (BERT) to evaluate your design.

• Conduct a Think aloud test and improve it according to your test-findings.

The assignment is iterative, meaning that you will have to redo your work several times.

• 1st iteration should be built by the aid of a card-sorting test.

• 2nd iteration should be made by the aid of an Expert Review and a BERT test

• 3rd or final iteration should be made by the aid of a final usability (think aloud) test.

# GROUPS:
You will have to work in groups (self-appointed, 3-5 members)
Since it is a relatively short assignment, you do not have to hand in a collaboration agreement.


# TASK SUBMISSIONS: 
• 05.02.01
1st iteration: content, wireframes and navigation structure.
A hand in, where you show the flowchart and the wireframes (mainly developed to show
location of content and functionality (navigation) on your web pages) you have developed,
based upon the results from your card-sorting test. You are also going to hand in the first
draft of your curriculum website, where you have implemented the site structure revealed
and decided upon after your card-sorting test and added relevant content according to
your chunking and decisions about what to communicate - and how. The text is going to be
proper content taken from the curriculum and not “Lorem ipsum”-text. You have
programmed it but you are not going to create any significant design. The site is going to
be made by wire frames, where you mainly show location of content and navigation
elements.

Feedback: Oral feedback on the spot


• 05.02.02
2nd iteration: Style tiles and BERT.
A hand in of the first attempt on your design, where you use style tiles to show connection
between the design and the functionality (style tiles could be looked as a “wireframes with
design”). Your style tiles are going to be used for the BERT test. Make at least three,
different design proposals. Conduct the BERT test and use results from the test to decide
on your final design.

Feedback A/NA on Fronter.


• 05.02.03
3rd iteration. Think Aloud Test, final design, final structure and final programming. Third
attempt on your curriculum site, where you have structured, programmed and designed it
according to your previous test results. This version of your site is going to be used for your
Think Aloud Test. Implement results from your Think Aloud Test and finish the final
curriculum website (which could be regarded as your 4th iteration...) you are going to
present on the final presentation day
Feedback: oral feedback on the spot.

# TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
• Suitable content must be fetched from an external JSON file

• Semantic markup, structured CSS and taking JavaScript as far as you can are all equally
important parts. Challenge yourselves, and think about how to use these technologies to
improve the UI and UX

• Use git / github daily, to make sure that all members can access the code at any time


#
3
• The CSS should reflect the responsive layout and graphical design as documented in the
design documentation (e.g. your wire frames and style tiles).

• Your final hand-in must be in the form of a “github page”, a feature not yet covered.

#PROCESS DOCUMENTATION - USER TEST LOG
We would like you to make a User test log, where you write down all you considerations about the
different tests you are working with. The user test log is your own document. It is not going to be
handed in and we are not going to give you feedback on it. Use it as a documentation of how you
have worked, learned and taken decisions while developing your Curriculum site. Use the
document in your coaching as a way to show us how you are progressing and as a point of
departure for a discussion of what you should do next.

Content of the process documentation:

1. General considerations
As always, it is impossible to plan, design and execute targeted communication without knowing
about the communication situation. Therefore, you should do some research to establish an
overview. Use obtained skills from previous semester to get this.
• Make a communication plan.
• Decide upon a target audience and describe them (personas).
• Make a suggested customer journey (the way you could imagine your customers/users
would interact with your curriculum site)

2. Card sorting test
• Write down all considerations about how you have labelled your cards: how did you chunk
the curriculum - and why? Did you plan an open or closed test? - and why?
• A description of how you conducted the card sorting test (how many people did you use
for the test? Did they do it one by one or did they co-work and discuss while taking it? How
many people did you use?(are they a part of the target group?) etc.)
• Pictures of the different solutions
• Analysis and discussions leading to your final flowchart that should also be included

3. Expert review
• What did the experts say (take notes while being reviewed and present the notes here)
• What did you conclude from the review? What did you decide to change? Show screen
dumps and describe the different flaws and errors that were identified.
• Explain how you want to change the site and explain why your changes will improve the
site.
• Show the changes. (e.g. screen dumps)

4. BERT
• Make sure that you have a screen dump of your index page (should be used for the test)
• Make a set of constructs - and argue for them: Why have you picked them? What are you
going to gain from the test?

#

4
• Make a graphical representation of the ideal interpretation of your index page mock up.
You can use this to identify differences between your “visual ambition” and the way your
target group interprets it and thereby clarify which changes you need to make.

• Describe the test: How many test persons? Who (in relation to your target group)? And
how?

• Show an approved version of your design. Describe what you have changed - and why
(according to the results from your BERT)

# Think aloud test
• Write tasks and justify them (what do you assume might be problematic about your site -
and what tasks are your respondents (test persons) going to try solving in order to expose
your suspicion?)

• Again: Describe the test - who? - how many? - how?

• Take notes/video to document our test.

• Show results and conclusions from the test. Use e.g. quotes from your respondents to back
up your conclusions.

• Show identified problems (e.g. navigation structure, misleading graphics, badly displayed
text etc.) Explain why they disturb /disrupt the usability.

• Show improvements and explain why they will enhance the usability.
